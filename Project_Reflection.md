# Correlation Analysis  
This analysis employed correlation and linear regression to explore the relationships between various meteorological variables and temperature. Our scatter plot matrix and kernel density estimates indicate that most variables have a positively skewed distribution, and overall, the linear correlations are weak. Notably, temperature and humidity show a significant positive correlation. However, since meteorological principles often suggest a more complex relationship between temperature and relative humidity, it's crucial to verify the definition of QBOT (e.g., whether it represents specific or absolute humidity) and integrate domain knowledge into our interpretation.  
In the univariate linear regression, humidity explained a substantial portion of temperature variation (R² = 0.768), compared to shortwave radiation (R² = 0.367). Given that the scatter plots reveal a curved relationship, using Spearman correlation might capture the association more effectively than Pearson correlation. Moreover, the multivariate regression, which included additional variables, increased the explained variance to 93%, with low multicollinearity as indicated by VIF values near 1.   
To enhance the analysis, first, review and clarify the definition of QBOT to ensure it accurately reflects the intended humidity measure. Second, given the curved relationship observed in the univariate analysis, consider adopting Spearman correlation or non-linear modeling techniques, which may better capture the underlying dynamics. Integrating these adjustments with robust domain knowledge will lead to a more accurate and meaningful interpretation of the meteorological data.
